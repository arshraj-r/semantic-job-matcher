We, RentoMojo, were founded by IITM alums and serial entrepreneurs who worked out of almost every major city in India

in his first five years of corporate career. Frustrated with the hassles of relocating from one place to the other, and tired of

finding that perfect cluster of home essentials that suited their lifestyle.

""The spending youth, especially the millennials & Gen Z's prefer staying light, desire flexibility and are value conscious.

Willing to experiment with new stuff across categories that make life simpler and not boring, these generations are also

sensitive to our planet's sustainability. Our customers and employees identify with what we do '', is what Geetansh

Bamania, our Founder and CEO has to say.

RentoMojo caters to the needs of the working professionals which is unmet due to nonavailability of furnished rental flats

by offering furniture and appliances on rental basis, thus, providing more flexibility than owning the expensive furniture and

appliances.

Currently, we have 130,000+ subscribers with a typical rental period of 1214 months. The current market size (as per a

recent report by Grant Thornton) is estimated to be US$ 4.1 Billion and expected to grow to US$ 13 Billion by 2025.

With 1000+ people operations, the company has a presence in 16 cities across India. Looking back, Rentomojo has not only

made a new market of lease which never existed for the consumer, they have also become market leaders in the consumer

rental industry. Unlike the norm, they are now seeing a reverse trend wherein a version of ours is being copied in the US

and UK. We are a profitable company and are excited about exponentially growing the profits of the company in months

and years to come.

Five Pillars Of Our Culture

Zoom InZoom Out :

We zoom in and go micro; our focus would be doing better in everything, including things we already do well.
We zoom

out a lot for creating successful pilots that can potentially scale into a lot of value add in the future, like strengthening our

offline presence.

Enterprising Mindset: If you are bold enough, you will have life changing growth opportunities here.

We will continue to expand the responsibilities of hungry and willing people. If you are ready to do what you have never done, you will find roles that you have never managed.
Growing people from within was a significant contributor to the Fortune employers choice award that we won in 2022

and more importantly that's one of the biggest reasons of our success & continued momentum

Frugality: Measure Twice and Cut once.

It is always easy to spend more money to get more done, but it lacks any form of challenge. We have to grow and become

better without a proportionate increase in cost.

For every penny that we spend or that we put up to spend, expect a lot of discussions, debates and conversations.

Planning is going to be important, data has to be the foundation, detailing will be a must and world class execution is the

only way we will move forward in this journey.

Accountability: Less Why, more How.

We will always have more to bite than we can chew, we will always have to make choices and prioritize while we

progress. We can have hundreds of reasons behind why something can not be done, but we have to remain focused on the

how of things. The focus on how will help us find ways to get done, what needs to get done.

Think, decide, play and act for the long term.

The only time we will make short term decisions is when they help us in the longer term. To me, the long term is all about

consistency and not intensity.
